# The application of *Behavior Driven Development* to *State of the Art* software development #

## Abstract ##

## Introduction ##
Behavior Driven Development BDD opens a new door in software development and in software testing. 
It make it possible to structure the application test code to a standard and keeps it readable. 

In the requirement state of a software project, the business analyst can describe in a textual simple standardised way the characteristics or behavior of the software with tasks, goals and results. The developers use these description and add the necessary test code, automated tests can then check the implementation for its correctness.

The following research is looking at frameworks supporting the Behavior Driven Development. 

## Methods ##
Criteria
* good code readability support for developer and __business knowledge engineers and domain analysts__
* supporting *state of the art* development including *dependency injection*, *aspect oriented programing* and modularization  
Necessary consequence
* the possibility to mock objects
Optional consequence
* convenience support for an IDE (integrated development environment) 
* available in common *build management tools*

## Results ##
* BDD for acceptance testing
* Well structured tests in regular development 
* good readability with groovy based testing

## Discussion ##
