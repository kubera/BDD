* best support for good readability for developer and __business domain knowledge engineers (correct expression?)__
* convenience support for an IDE (integrated development environment) 
* available in common *build managment tools*

## Results ##
* BDD for acceptance testing
* Well structured tests in regular development 

* good readability with groovy based testing
