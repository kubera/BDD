# BDD #
Comparing *Behavior Driven Development* __BDD__ Frameworks

## Abstract ##

## Introduction ##
Behavior Driven Development opens a new door in application development and in software testing. 
It make it possible to structure the application test code to a standard and keeps it readable. 

In the requirement state of a software project, the business analyst can describe in a textual simple standardised way the characteristics or behavior of the software with tasks, goals and results. The developers use these description and add the necessary test code, automated tests can then check the implementation for its correctness.

The following research is looking at frameworks supporting the Behavior Driven Development. 

## Methods ##
Criteria
* best support for good readability for developer and __business domain knowledge engineers (correct expression? business analysts)__
* supporting *state of the art* development including *dependency injection* and *aspect oriented programing* 
* the possibility to mock objects
* convenience support for an IDE (integrated development environment) 
* available in common *build management tools*

## Results ##
* BDD for acceptance testing
* Well structured tests in regular development 
* good readability with groovy based testing
